    "response": "Sure, we can use GitHub for project management, Notion for project documentation, and Slack for communication. First, create a new repository in GitHub to track the project tasks. Then, set up a related workspace in Notion to document project specifications, goals, and timelines. Lastly, create a new Slack channel for the team to discuss the project and schedule a kick-off meeting to align on the project's scope and objectives.",
