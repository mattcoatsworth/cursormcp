    "query": "Can you help me identify and reengage customers who have churned from our Shopify store?",
    "response": "Certainly! To identify and reengage churned customers from your Shopify store, we can utilize a combination of Shopify, Klaviyo, and Postscript. First, we'll export a list of churned customers from Shopify, then import this list into Klaviyo to create a targeted segment. In Klaviyo, we'll set up an automated email flow to reengage these customers based on their shopping history and behavior. Finally, we can integrate Postscript to send SMS messages as part of the reengagement campaign, providing a multi-channel approach to reach out to churned customers.",
