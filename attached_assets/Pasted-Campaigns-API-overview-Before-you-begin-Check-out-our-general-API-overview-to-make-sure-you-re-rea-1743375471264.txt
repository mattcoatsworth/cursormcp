Campaigns API overview
Before you begin
Check out our general API overview to make sure you’re ready to get started with specific endpoints.

A campaign is a way to send a targeted message to an audience (lists and/or segments). Unlike a flow, which is triggered every time a condition is met, a campaign is a scheduled message (e.g., a holiday sale announcement via SMS). Our Campaigns API supports email, SMS, and push notification campaigns with the following endpoint categories:

Campaigns

Create, retrieve, update, and delete campaigns.

Messages

Retrieve and update campaign messages.

Jobs

Send a campaign using a campaign send job, or fetch an estimated number of recipients using a recipient estimation job.

Relationships

Access data on campaign messages, tags, and templates related to a specific campaign.

Use cases
The Campaigns API supports a number of use cases. Some of the more common use cases include:

Use smart send time as a send strategy to schedule a campaign and manage the campaign send job’s status.
Preview content by fetching a template associated with an email campaign’s message.
Estimate the number of recipients for a given campaign.
Clone and resend an existing campaign to different audiences.
📘
Campaigns will not be sent out to profiles who have not provided consent (implicit for email and explicit for SMS). Learn about best practices for collecting email and SMS consent.

Data model
Campaigns are similar in structure, but differ in how they are sent and tracked, for example, only email campaigns can track clicks and opens. Check out how to send an email, SMS, or push campaign for more information on request structure and their responses.

Smart send time and smart sending
Smart send time and smart sending are robust automations that help you build healthy relationships with your target audience. Both tools leverage customer data to achieve customer-first interactions.

Smart send time
This feature helps you determine the optimal time to email your customers by analyzing trends of when your target audiences are most likely to open your email campaigns.

📘
Note that you must be able to send campaigns to an audience of 12,000 or greater to be eligible for smart send time.

Smart sending
This feature prevents you from sending a recipient too many messages at once. Recipients who have recently received a campaign within a set time frame (for example, within 24 hours) will be skipped from receiving the campaign.

🚧
Recipients who are skipped from campaigns due to smart sending will not automatically receive the campaign at a later date. Learn more about resending email campaigns.

}

Update your campaign
Once the campaign has been created, it will be in “draft” status until it is scheduled to be sent. While your push campaign is in draft, you can update the following:

Campaign attributes

Retrieve your campaign ID (Get Campaigns) and call Update Campaign to update campaign attributes such as send and tracking options.

Campaign message

Use your campaign ID to fetch the campaign message (Get Campaign Campaign Messages) and call Update Campaign to update your campaign’s message.

Schedule a campaign send job
When your push campaign is ready to be scheduled:

Estimate the number of campaign recipients with Create Campaign Recipient Estimation Job (see Estimate campaign recipients).
Schedule the campaign with the Create Campaign Send Job endpoint (see Schedule a campaign send job).
Estimate campaign recipients
Our Campaigns API allows you to run an estimation of your expected recipient count before sending your campaign with Create Campaign Recipient Estimation Job. Once scheduled, you can use Get Campaign Recipient Estimation Job to check on the job’s status (“queued,” “processing,” “cancelled,” or “complete”) and retrieve the estimated recipient count.

Schedule a campaign send job
When your campaign is ready to be sent, you can call Create Campaign Send Job to asynchronously trigger a campaign send. Once scheduled, you can use Get Campaign Send Job to check on the job’s status (“queued,” “processing,” “cancelled,” or “complete”). You can use Update Campaign Send Job to revert the campaign to a draft or cancel the campaign entirely. Note that if you cancel a campaign and would like to resend it, you’ll have to use Create Campaign Clone which will create a clone of the desired campaign in “draft” status, and then schedule a new campaign send job.

Burst API send jobs vs stream send jobs
How you handle your requests can impact the performance of your campaign send job.

Consider the goal of the campaign:

The campaign is time-sensitive, designed to reach your audience as soon as possible.
You are sending campaigns based on realtime data and require time between sends to collect and deliver data.
Here’s how each approach might affect campaign sends, based on your campaign's goals:

Burst API calls in campaign sends
The burst method is recommended for one-off campaign sends.

Advantages
Efficiency: Sending a large number of campaign messages in a short period can be efficient for specific scenarios where all messages need to be delivered at once.
Example: you are offering a promotion to the first 100 customers who purchase XXX item. You want all profiles on the list to receive the campaign as fast as possible to ensure all customers have the same odds of success.
Simplicity: Implementation is less complex; you can send a batch of messages in one go.
Predictability: Easier to predict when messages will be sent and received since the send process is concentrated into a single burst.
Disadvantages
Rate Limits: API rate limits can be a significant constraint, as sending too many requests in a short period might lead to throttling or blocking. Check the API reference for the endpoint you are using to determine the rate limit.
Deliverability Issues: Sending a large number of messages at once can increase the likelihood that email and message providers flag your sends as spam.
Stream API calls in campaign sends
The stream method is recommended if you are sending long-term or continuous campaigns.

Advantages
Real-Time Delivery: Messages send as soon as the data becomes available, ensuring timely delivery.
Rate Management: Continuous, paced delivery helps manage and stay within API rate limits.
Load Distribution: Distributes the server load over time, reducing the risk of overload and downtime.
Improved Deliverability: Lower risk of a spam flag, as messages are sent in a steady cadence.
Disadvantages
Complexity: Implementing a streaming solution may require persistent connections and more sophisticated error handling.
Latency: There can be slight delays between data availability and message sending, depending on the stream's implementation.
Get campaign(s)
The Get Campaigns endpoint is useful for fetching data about campaigns, such as included audiences. Note that for fetching campaigns, you’ll need to include a channel filter for listing campaign type; otherwise you will receive a 400 error. When making a Get Campaign or Get Campaigns request, here’s an example of how it could look:

Request
Response

curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://a.klaviyo.com/api/campaigns/?filter=equals(messages.channel, 'email')' \
     --header 'Authorization: Klaviyo-API-Key your-private-api-key' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'revision: 2023-12-15'
Querying campaigns
Querying campaigns with the Campaigns API is useful for viewing campaign statuses. Check out the supported query parameters below and test them with our latest Postman collection. Note that support for given operators is endpoint-specific. Review the API reference documentation for more information on allowed fields and query operators.

Parameter	Description	Query example
filter	Retrieve a subset of campaigns, e.g., email campaigns with a name containing “sale.” Learn about the filter query parameter.

Note that for fetching campaigns, you’ll need to include a channel filter for listing campaign type; otherwise you will receive a 400 error.	GET /api/campaigns?filter=equals(messages.channel, ‘email’)

GET /api/campaigns?filter=equals(messages.channel, ‘sms’)

GET /api/campaigns?filter=and(equals(messages.channel,’email’),contains(name, ‘sale’)
