Create flows and retrieve flow attributes with Flows API
ðŸš§
These endpoints are in beta and are subject to change.

A beta revision header (2024-10-15.pre) is required to use these beta APIs. Klaviyo APIs in beta are not intended for use in production. See our versioning and deprecation policy for more information.

Before you begin
Check out our general Flows API overview to make sure youâ€™re ready to get started with specific Flows endpoints.

The Flows API can be used to create and retrieve Klaviyo flows and their attributes.

Beta limitations
The following actions are not currently supported:
A/B test actions â€” creation of A/B test variants for email & SMS
Once a flow has been created, there currently isn't a way to update that flow via API. This is planned for a future release.

Use cases
These beta Flows API endpoints can be used to achieve the following use cases:

Create a flow
Create a metric-triggered flow for cart and browse abandonment use cases.
Create a date-triggered birthday flow that gives customers a reward on their birthday.
Create a price-drop flow that notifies customers when an item they were viewing is discounted.
Retrieve a flow's definition
For any flow, retrieve its definition to see how the flow is defined.
Data model
A flow has the following structure:

id

The ID of the flow.

attributes

name
The name of the segment.

definition
The flow's definition.

triggers
The conditions that trigger a flow. Currently, a flow can have exactly 1 trigger.

actions
The set of actions that make up the flow, for example, time delays, email/SMS/push notifications, webhooks, and conditional splits.

profile_filter
The filter containing specified condition(s) checked on the profile to determine whether or not the profile qualifies for the flow (e.g., the profile has consented to receive SMS marketing).

entry_action_id
The ID of the starting action of the flow.

status
The current status of the flow, e.g., Draft, Manual, Live.

archived
A boolean value indicating whether the flow is archived.

created
Timestamp of when the flow was created.

updated
Timestamp of when the flow was last updated.

trigger_type:
The type of trigger for the flow. See Supported trigger types for more information.

ðŸ“˜
You can download the Flows API postman collection for a quickstart, or view these Flows API reference docs to interactively explore flows' structure.

Create a flow
POST /api/flows/

Below we have outlined the recommended workflow for creating a new flow via Flows API.

Create a flow with your desired settings in the Klaviyo UI.
Retrieve that flow via the Get Flows API: GET /api/flows/:id?additional-fields[flow]=definition
Make the following changes to the response body from the previous step to get the request body into a shape accepted by the API.
Delete relationships and links from data.
Remove created, updated, status, trigger_type from attributes.
For each action in the attributes.definition.actions array, update the temporary_id field to reference the value of the id field. Then, delete the id field.
All flows are created in a Draft status by default, unless action status is otherwise set in your initial request.

ðŸš§
We don't recommend pre-creation of flows in customer accounts. There should be a guided UX for creating these flows, so users know where they came from.

When creating a flow, actions are uniquely identified by a temporary_id. This identifier does not persist after saving. Once the flow is saved and returned via API, each action is returned with Klaviyo-generated IDs referenced in the links.

Create a drag-and-drop flow template
If you're looking to create a flow that has a drag-and-drop template for a "Send email" action, you can create HTML or hybrid templates via the Create Template API.

To learn more about hybrid templates check out the guide to creating a hybrid email template.

ðŸ“˜
We currently support up to 2 drag-and-drop templates per app partner. Please submit an example flow using this form. Note that your submission is for the Create Flow API. Our team will reply with the template_ids needed to enable the following workflow.

Call Clone Template API using the template_id provided by our team.

Call the Create Flow API using the ID of the template in the Clone Template API response as the template_id in a "send-email" action.

Retrieve a flow's definition
GET /api/flows/{id}/?additional-fields[flow]=definition

We've added the ability to optionally retrieve a flow's definition alongside other attributes.

The example response below returns a metric-triggered flow with a time delay and a conditional split that will cause the profile to receive an email:
